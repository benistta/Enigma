Self Assessment:


Functionality: Meets Expectations. Encrypt and decrypt methods successfully implemented in the Enigma class. Encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces successfully implemented

Object Oriented Programming: Above Expectations. Implemented a module that makes sense to the overall organization of the project.

Ruby Conventions and Mechanics: Meets Expectations. Code properly indented, spaced and lines are not excessively long. Enumerables chosen are most efficient. Class, method, variable, and file names follow convention. At least one hash is implemented.

Test Driven Development: Meets Expectations. Every method is tested verifying expected behavior. Obvious edge cases are addressed. Tests are written before the implementation of code.
